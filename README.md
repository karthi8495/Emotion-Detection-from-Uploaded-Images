# Emotion Detection from Uploaded Images
# Project Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive system that detects and classifies human emotions from uploaded images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The application is built using Python and integrated into a user-friendly Streamlit interface. The project combines cutting-edge techniques from machine learning, computer vision, and user interface design to provide real-time emotion classification. The solution targets real-world applications in domains like healthcare, education, and customer service, where emotion recognition can offer valuable insights.

# Objective
The primary objective of this project is to design, implement, and optimize a complete system that allows users to upload images, detects faces, and classifies emotions using pre-trained CNN models. The system is designed to be efficient, accurate, and easy to use, with a focus on enhancing emotion detection capabilities using state-of-the-art models and techniques.

# Features
# User Interface Development:
A Streamlit-based web application allows users to easily upload images and receive real-time emotion classification results. The interface is intuitive, responsive, and provides clear instructions to the user.

# Facial Detection:
The application utilizes Mediapipe for accurate facial detection, ensuring that emotions are classified based only on faces detected in the uploaded images. Bounding boxes are drawn around detected faces in the images for visual feedback.

# Emotion Classification:
Multiple pre-trained CNN models, including DenseNet, ResNet, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and a custom CNN, are used to classify emotions such as 'angry', 'disgust', 'fear', 'happy', 'sad', 'surprise', and 'neutral'.

# Ethical Considerations:
The project includes an analysis of the ethical implications of emotion detection technology, discussing privacy concerns, bias in data, and the ethical use of such technologies in sensitive areas like healthcare and law enforcement.
